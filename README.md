## Stefaan Fangman | Assignment Submission

In the project directory, you run the following command in your terimnal:

### `npm start`

All data submitted in the Add Form will be stored into localStorage.
You may Addd, View and Delete data that stored there via this App.

**Unfortunately, I was not not able to implement the 'update existing contact' function, but I have placed some pseudo code within the edit form file (/src/features/editForm/index.js)**
